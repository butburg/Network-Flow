 * The exercise is to implement the FordFulkerson-algorithm, using the shortest aug-
 * mentation path in each step (Edmonds and Karpâ€™s version). Given a graph with
 * capacities your program shall output the value of an optimal flow, the flow over each
 * edge, and a cut (the one given by the algorithm) proving that the flow is optimal.
 * The graph is a directed graph, i.e. the capacity from vertex u to vertex v can be
 * different from the capacity from v back to u. All capacities are integer and non-
 * negative.
